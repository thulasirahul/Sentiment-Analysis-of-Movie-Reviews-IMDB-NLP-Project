# üé¨ IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using Python, NLP, and Logistic Regression in an end-to-end ML pipeline.

---

## üìå Project Objective

To build a robust and accurate machine learning model that:
- Understands and processes raw textual movie reviews
- Classifies them into **Positive** or **Negative** sentiment
- Can generalize to unseen reviews with high confidence

---

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Name**: [IMDB Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- **Total reviews**: 50,000  
  - 25,000 positive  
  - 25,000 negative  
- Balanced dataset with binary sentiment labels  
- Used in `.csv` format with `review` and `sentiment` columns

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Convert text to lowercase  
   - Remove non-alphabetic characters  
   - Tokenize text  
   - Remove stopwords using NLTK  
   - Apply stemming using `PorterStemmer`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked dataset structure  
   - Plotted sentiment distribution

3. **Text Vectorization**  
   - Applied `TfidfVectorizer` with max 5000 features

4. **Model Building**  
   - Used `Logistic Regression` within a Scikit-learn Pipeline  
   - Train-test split (80/20)

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Classification report  
   - Confusion matrix

6. **Prediction**  
   - Tested the model on new reviews

## üìà Results

### üîπ Classification Report

**Accuracy: 89%**

| Class        | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Negative (0) | 0.90      | 0.87   | 0.88     | 4961    |
| Positive (1) | 0.87      | 0.90   | 0.89     | 5039    |
| **Overall**  |           |        | **0.89** | 10000   |

‚úÖ The model performs with high accuracy and balanced class metrics.

## üß™ Live Predictions

Tested on two custom reviews:

```python
new_reviews = [
    "I absolutely loved this movie! The storyline was fantastic and the acting was superb.",
    "This was the worst film I have ever seen. It was a total waste of time."
]
```
